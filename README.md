# SARDINE THROWER

Sardine Thrower is a simple game that will allow the common person to practice his or hers sardine catching skills.

This is of the utmost importance, as one approaches the Santo António celebrations in Lisbon. 

The Sardine Thrower project was developed by the 17# Bootcamp Code Cadets at Academia de Código, namely Mariana Liberato, Marina Henriques, Nuno Ramalho and Renato Afonso.

## GAMEPLAY

The goal of this game is to catch as many sardines as possible while avoiding the pots with basil. Sardines increase score and pots will decrease health. Be careful not to drop sardines, as they also decrease health. One should not waste food...

You may also drink as many beers as you want but they may have an undesirable effect. Take a [Guronsan](http://www.guronsan.pt/) pill to revert those effects.

To catch the sardines you will be provided with a bread slice, as required by Lisbon's local holiday, which you can move using the `left` and `right` keys.

To restart the game use `r` key. The `p` key pauses the game.

If the sardines run out before your health reaches zero, you win the game.

### LEAVING THE GAME

While we cannot fathom the reason to do so, if you really must exit press `e` key.


## DEVELOPMENT

This is the beta version fo this game and features will be added somewhere down the road.
